          <h1> We Believe </h1>
          <p>An openness to learn from multiple realities broadens our perspective<br />
          Acceptance and appreciation of differences makes the world a beautiful and multilayered mosaic<br />
          Freedom of choice leads to a greater sense of ownership towards shared spaces<br />

          <h1> We Assume </h1>
          <p>Young people have immense potential to think constructively to bring about positive change<br />
          Every individual has an active citizen in him/her waiting to be revealed through the appropriate sparks<br /> 
          The ability to question absolute power and the zeal to initiate positive action creates a society that is more just and equitable.</p>
