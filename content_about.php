          <p>
            Young people have immense potential to think constructively to bring about positive change<br />
            Every individual has an active citizen in him/her waiting to be revealed through
            the appropriate sparks<br />
            The ability to question absolute power and the zeal to initiate positive action
            creates a society that is more just and equitable<br />
