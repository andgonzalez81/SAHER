            A process where young people from colleges and communities go
            through a journey of self-exploration while learning collectively.
            It is an interactive programme where experiential learning enables
            youth to:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>
              Explore their abilities and dreams, such that they begin their journeys as
              agents of social change </li>
              <li>
              Understand that there are multiple and diverse realities 
              in the world and recognise and respect differences </li>
              <li>
              Imbibe skills to deal better
              with conflicts and negotiate day-to-day relationships in any sphere of life </li>
              <li> Develop a sense of ownership and responsibility towards community resources </li>
            </ul>
              Weekly sessions, discussion circles, exposure trips, rural camps, action
              projects, short internships and campaigns on social issues mark the journey that
              starts with building competencies and gradually moves into exposure to multiple
              realities, perspective building and initiating social action.
