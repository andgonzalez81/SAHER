          <p>Bala, living in a Hindu dominated settlement held up a paper bag he
          had just made out of newspapers. "I plan to use this to carry my
          Karate uniform instead of the plastic bags I've been carrying so far".
          The lanky 19 year old was part of a group of around 40 young boys and
          girls from Hindu and Muslim communities engaged in understanding
          issues related to environment and sustainable development. They went
          for a camp at an organic farm in Panchgani, returned to script a
          street play on the hazards of using plastic and their efforts
          culminated in a campaign on "Volunteering for Our Planet" on 5th
          December 2009. Now, Bala has his closest friends among Muslims and is
          a regular volunteer at SAHER's Community Centre.</p>
