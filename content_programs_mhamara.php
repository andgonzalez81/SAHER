            Annual Peace Week Content - We are a country where more than 100 languages, a little more than twenty
            religious beliefs and a multitude of cuisines come together each day to stir up a
            pretty mosaic. And yet, these are the same wedges that are driven into the
            mosaic to polarize people and propagate a vision of citizenship that traps the
            'self' in borders drawn around identities that exclude the 'other'<br />
            <br />
            
            One such effort towards fostering interaction across communities and building peace is the Annual
            Peace Week with the following objectives:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Creating a platform for children from different backgrounds (English, Urdu, Hindi,
                Marathi and Gujarati media schools)to play, interact and know each other
              </li>
              <li>
              Interweaving a spirit of coming together and breaking barriers of identities such as
              religion, class and gender and making it a vital part of children's education as they
              grow up
              </li>
              <li>
              Encouraging volunteerism among youth to organise such events that create positive
              spaces for expression and social action
              </li>
              <li>
              Creating spaces for the community to interact and exchange to foster mutual respect
              and understanding through sports
              </li>
            </ul>

            The Right to Information Act came into force on 13 October 2005. The Right to
            Information Act 2005 is a law enacted by the Parliament of India giving citizens
            of India access to records of the Central Government and State Governments. The
            Act applies to all States and Union Territories of India, except the State of
            Jammu and Kashmir - which is covered under a State-level law. Under the
            provisions of the Act, any citizen (including the citizens within J&K) may
            request information from a "public authority" (a body of Government or
            "instrumentality of State") which is required to reply expeditiously or within
            thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to computerise their
            records for wide dissemination and to proactively publish certain categories of
            information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for
            information formally.
