            NEENV is a program that essentially facilitates the process of a systems interface
            between the Youth and the City. Rather than provide employment
            references, it works to create a higher employabililty qoutient so
            Youth are equipped with life skills and technical competency to
            seek jobs or start enterprises and take their rightful place in the
            resource-rich economy. In order to create the appropriate
            intervention, it becomes necessary to employ the scientific method
            and temper it with our spirit of fervour and activism - our Junoon.
            Therefore we decided to survey the environment and capture data for
            further analysis and action. So, we surveyed the Youth and carried
            out statistical analysis. At the same time we surveyed the
            employers and other service providers. Then we created our
            intervention in the form of a resource bank called
            <a href="tameer.php">"Tameer"</a> to address the
            requirements of the Youth.
