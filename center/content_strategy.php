            <h1>Core Strategies</h1>
            <b>Working with adolescents and youth:</b> To provide spaces to young
            people to interact and explore their abilities, such that they begin
            their journeys as agents of social change. The attempt here is to
            ensure that the youth recognize their abilities and identify their
            rights to be in a position to realize their mutual relationship with
            each other and the surrounding environment <br/><br/>
            <b>Building awareness: </b> To address the issue of social peace through
            civic awareness and facilitation of collective action that caters to
            the common needs across communities, irrespective of socially and
            politically constructed differences and identities <br/><br/>
            <b>Bridging the gap between communities: </b>To develop an understanding of
            a heterogeneous social context by breaking stereotypes and
            undertaking activities that involve people from various
            backgrounds<br/><br/>
