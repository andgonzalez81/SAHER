            <h1>Process Model</h1>  
            We work with youth from colleges and communities, adolescents from schools in
            the community and with people at large.<br/>
            Youth from diverse communities lack exposure to each other and to
            new ideas, leading to closed, unreflective minds and prejudices
            towards different people and views. This restricts them from taking
            initiatives and exploring creative options in career and social
            action.<br/> 
            Addressing this learning gap, SAHER creates a space where young people:
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                discover themselves
              </li>
              <li>
              identify their orientation towards conflict handling
              </li>
              <li>
                develop their perspectives around respect for diversity, social action and career
                choices.
              </li>
            </ul>
